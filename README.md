# ao3MobileRedux Script Collection

A stripped-down fork of tuffs' ao3 savior userscript for ease of use on compatible mobile browser apps.
The source scripts can all be run from desktop browsers using extensions like greasemonkey or tampermonkey.
Ao3 savior has been combined into a single file w/ the debug code removed so it's a little easier to navigate using a touchscreen phone.

(Specifically used w/ Alook browser for iOS, which will run custom Javascript automatically when a page from a specified URL is loaded)

Ao3 savior allows works to be hidden and/or whitelisted based on tag, author, or summary keywords (ao3_savior_mobile_no_lang.js)
